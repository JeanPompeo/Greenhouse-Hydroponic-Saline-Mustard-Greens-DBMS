Project Title,Greenhouse Grown Mustard Greens in Hydroponic Saline Irrigation Treatments,
Project Description,"An experiment will be conducted to grow and evaluate the performance of five novel salt tolerant mustard genotypes under hydroponic production in saline nutrient solutions in a greenhouse located in Citra, FL. Six separate hydroponic systems are split into two groups of three on the eastern and western halves of the greenhouse. Five salinity concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50%) will be evaluated along with a fresh water (0%) salt control.  Each hydroponic system supports 120 plants, allowing for 20 replicates per salt tolerant cultivar plus one control, with each experimental condition being replicated four times. Plant growth data will be evaluated over time, blocked by cultivar and by treatment condition. Sensor systems will be implemented to monitor weather conditions in the greenhouse, micro-climates of the eastern and western plant canopy groups, and of each nutrient solution reservoir. Calibration data will be maintained for each sensor within the sensor systems. ",
